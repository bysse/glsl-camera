# glsl-camera
This project only has two camera functions that is intended to be used from inside a
GLSL shader. Even though I'm fairly versed in linear algebra and matrix operations I 
still struggled to get these two matrices correct for OpenGL.
Hopefully I can shave off a few hours of frustration from someone's project or my 
future self for that matter.

Please let me know if you find problems.
